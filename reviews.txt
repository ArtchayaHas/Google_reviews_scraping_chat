Review: The exhibition at this aquarium was very nice.  However, there are two
problems.  One is that the only payment method is cash.  The second is that the
staff's response is not good.  The staff at the admission ticket office
responded according to the manual, and the five-member family customer in front
of me pitifully stopped admission and went home.  The staff who guides you at
the entrance cannot guide you smoothly.  As a result, the passage before going
to the back of the building became a large line, and many people complained.
The end of the large line was very empty.  I was disappointed.  The inside of
the aquarium was vacant and comfortable, unlike the area near the entrance.  The
exhibition of deep-sea fish was also devised.  It was fun to watch.The

highlights are dark room viewing of deep sea luminescent fishes and beautifully
preserved fishes that come in blue and red. It says hard bones are stained red

like. Opened in 2012 and getting popular once NHK, national broadcasting,
released the video that captured gigantic squid alive in the deep sea.Top
features: 1) Coelacanths (both frozen and stuffing): Very rare in Japan due to
strict trading rules these days. Those are imported before the regulations were
effective.2) Bathynomus giganteus3) Fresh local deep sea creatures (Suruga bay
is the deepest bay in Japan.)One staff answered my questions so sincerely and in
details. So nice! It seemed staffs are proud of and enjoy working there. They
are effectively displaying all creatures, and hold some presentations (Japanese
only by staffs).Overall, kids must love this place and even some adults can
enjoy a lot surely. Highly recommended place to visit! Note that weekends are so
crowded. Go in the morning or weekdays. ;) Enjoy!Very wonderful place to visit!

Review: This is an aquarium where you can see frozen coelacanths, which are rare
in the world!The coelacanth was discovered as a fossil and was once thought to
be extinct, but it is said to be a living fossil because it was discovered alive
one day. Because it is designated as an internationally endangered species,
permission is required for commercial use, and it seems that there are very few
exhibits that have permission. In this aquarium, there are 5 animals including
stuffed animals...? You can see about it.In addition, since Numazu Port is near
the deep sea, the aquarium exhibits many deep-sea fish, which are rare even in
Japan. This is because deep-sea fish salvaged at Numazu Port can be stored
immediately. The exhibits are changed regularly, so you won't get bored. I
thought it would be a little small from the outside, but the inside was
surprisingly spacious and quite impressive.If you show your ticket at a nearby
restaurant or souvenir shop, you may receive a 10% discount, so we recommend

different from other aquariums. The lighting was dimmed, perhaps to create the
atmosphere of the deep sea, which gave a good impression.There was also a frozen
coelacanth exhibit, and it was fun to see so many things that can only be seen

admission fee of 1,800 yen seems a little high considering the number of living
creatures, but I hope that you will do your best to make this a unique

fish push and a coelacanth push. I visited on a Saturday around 2:00pm, when it
seemed to be the busiest time, but I was able to get in without lining up. For
the entrance fee, credit cards cannot be used. Only PayPay and cash. Please be
careful about this point.It's not a big aquarium. Of course, there is no dolphin
show, so even if you take your time, it will only take about an hour.The
aquarium's favorites are deep-sea fish, especially the octopus and coelacanth.
The deep sea fish are mainly exhibited in Suruga Bay, and the coelacanth is
probably related to the deep sea.In any case, it was a compact and fun
aquarium.Visited on Weekend  Wait time No wait  Reservation recommended NoThis

Review: It is the world's first aquarium themed around deep-sea creatures, and
it is also the only aquarium in the world that displays frozen specimens of
coelacanths.Although the theme is ``deep-sea creatures,'' the deep-sea creatures
on display account for less than half of the total number of exhibits, and most
of the deep-sea creatures on display are between 200m and 500m deep. There are
almost no exhibits of deep-sea creatures that live in places so deep that even
light cannot reach them, and the exhibits are limited to video exhibits. This is
not only because most deep-sea creatures are difficult to capture, but also
because their ecology is shrouded in mystery, making it difficult to raise them.
In addition, their habitat is subject to strong water pressure, so it is
extremely difficult to prepare large aquariums, perhaps because they have
created a simulated environment for this, and most aquariums used for
exhibitions are small. As a result, it is easy for viewers to crowd together,
and it becomes extremely crowded mainly from mid-morning to early afternoon on
holidays. Naturally, there are no dolphin shows, and since the facility is
located in a corner of Numazu Port, it is not possible to install a large-scale
aquarium in the first place. Although you can't expect any impressive exhibits
of marine life, there is no doubt that viewers will be excited by the large
number of deep-sea creatures on display that are rarely seen at other aquariums.
It's also fascinating to see stuffed animals such as the Rabbi deer and
megamouth, which are extremely difficult to find, let alone catch.The exhibition
space in the museum consists of the first and second floors.The first floor has
an exhibition themed on the deep sea creatures mentioned above, while the second
floor has two frozen specimens of coelacanths and a plastic coelacanth. Three
are on display. Currently, coelacanths are designated as an endangered species,
and although it is impossible to see them live up close, there is an opportunity
to see a real coelacanth up close, even if it is a frozen or stuffed specimen.
Not very likely. On the other hand, it's not as crowded as the deep-sea aquarium
on the first floor, so you can enjoy the view at a relatively leisurely
pace.Escalators and elevators are installed, so even people with disabilities
such as wheelchairs can easily use the facility.Please note that the only
payment method for admission fees is cash or PayPay. Although not all exhibits,
many exhibits have explanations in English as well as Japanese, so I think even
tourists from overseas can enjoy it.It's the world's first aquarium themed on
deep-sea life and the only aquarium in the world to exhibit a frozen specimen of
a coelacanth.Although the theme is "deep-sea life," the number of deep-sea
creatures on display is less than half of the total number of exhibits, most of
the deep-sea creatures on display are in the range of 200m to 500m in depth ,
and there are almost no exhibits of deep-sea organisms that live in areas so
deep that light cannot reach them. This is not only because most deep-sea
creatures are difficult to capture, but also because their ecology is shrouded
in mystery and they are not easy to keep in captivity. In addition, the habitat
is subject to strong water pressure, which makes it extremely difficult to
prepare a large tank, and most of the tanks used for exhibits are small. This
makes it easy for visitors to become crowded with other visitors, and it is
extremely crowded on holidays, mainly from mid-morning to mid-afternoon.
Naturally, there are no dolphin shows, and since the facility is located in a
corner of Numazu Port, it is not possible to set up a large tank in the first
place. Although it is not expected to have any powerful marine life exhibits,
the array of deep-sea creatures on display, which are rarely seen in other
aquariums, is sure to thrill visitors. It is also fascinating to see stuffed
specimens of Frill shark and Megamouth Shark, which are extremely difficult to
find, let alone capture.The first floor is dedicated to the mentioned deep-sea
creatures, while the second floor displays two frozen and three stuffed
coelacanths. Coelacanths are currently listed as an endangered species, and
although it's not possible to see them alive up close, it's not often that
visitors have the opportunity to see real coelacanths up close, even if they are
frozen or stuffed specimens. On the other hand, it's not as crowded as the deep-
sea tank on the first floor, so you can enjoy the exhibit at a relatively
leisurely pace.Both escalators and elevators are available, making it easy for
visitors with disabilities, such as wheelchairs, to use the museum.Note that
admission fees can only be paid in cash or by PayPay. Many, but not all, of the
exhibits have explanations in English as well as Japanese, so visitors from
overseas can also enjoy them.Visited on Weekend  Wait time Up to 10 min

Review: An aquarium specializing in deep-sea fish and coelacanths. There are
many things you can't see in a normal aquarium, and it's interesting to see how
shallow and deep sea creatures compare. There's a hands-on corner where you can
touch deep-sea fish, and you can see what the part of a Chinese eel buried in
the sand looks like, so you won't find any other unusual exhibits. It's also
interesting to learn about stuffed coelacanths, fish prints, coelacanth
research, and their history.There are shops and deep-sea fish cafes around the
aquarium where you can eat deep-sea fish, and since it's located in Numazu Port,
there's a compact collection of fresh and delicious fish dishes that you can

Suruga Bay is the deepest in Japan at 6000m. It is interesting that many of the

The explanation itself took about 10 minutes. I was a little surprised when they
told me how many real coelacanths were on display.It's different from other

Review: This is an aquarium where you can see the deep sea creatures of Suruga
Bay, which boasts the deepest water in Japan.There is also a giant beetle that
has become famous because it does not eat at all, which is very

Review: Some reviews say that 1,800 yen for adults is expensive considering the
size of the facility, but even if everyone has their own opinion, I think it's
worth it if you have even the slightest interest in marine life.First, it is
extremely difficult to sustainably raise deep-sea creatures, for which there is
little knowledge about their ecology. It's amazing that we are able to do this
with so many different types of organisms. Procuring food and maintaining water
quality and temperature conditions must be costly.It may also be the largest
collection in the world of four coelacanth specimens on display. Two of them are
kept frozen, so in a sense they are Namazakana (the others are stuffed). Due to
the Washington Convention, it is no longer possible to bring a single coelacanth
scale into Japan, so being able to see it is extremely valuable.An aquarium is
not just about dolphin shows and giant aquariums. Many deep-sea creatures have
unique shapes and colors, so I think you can enjoy just looking at their
designs. I recommend it.Some reviews say that 1,800 yen for adults is expensive

Review: As an aquarium specializing in deep-sea fish,I had known about it for a
while, but due to time constraints I couldn't go.I stopped by Awashima Marine
Park to cleanse my palate after suffering from indigestion.The first floor has a
ticket counter and deep-sea creature exhibits.The second floor has exhibits
about coelacanths, deep-sea sharks, and an exhibit introducing familiar fish, as
well as a shop.I felt that most of the deep sea fish are slow-moving types and
are suitable for adults.The exterior of the exhibition aquarium is also
elaborately designed, and you can see fossils of deep-sea fish here and there in
the dim light, so you won't get bored looking for them or being surprised by a
giant fish fossil.There is also an exhibit of Hikari Kinmedai, which is a little
small, but it is both creepy and fantastic, so I recommend it.When you go up to
the second floor, there is an exhibition of materials related to coelacanths,
and in the back there is an actual frozen coelacanth on display.It is the main
feature of the deep sea fish aquarium.Personally, I was impressed by the display
of familiar fish.The exhibits were so interesting that they were full of humor,
such as exhibits of open horse mackerel in a horse mackerel aquarium, and
exhibits of creatures that are used as sushi ingredients.There were displays of
materials about deep-sea sharks such as the shark and megamouth, as well as a
stuffed oarfish, and there was a shop at the back, which was a little
small.Visited on Weekday  Wait time No wait  Reservation recommended YesAs an

Review: I had high expectations because it's called a deep-sea fish aquarium,
but I was disappointed because, except for the frozen specimens of coelacanths,
octopuses, and golden medlars, there were only things that could be seen in the
deep-sea corners of other aquariums.My child likes deep-sea fish, so we visited
as the main part of our trip, but my expectations were a little
disappointed.Hikari Kinmedai was so dark that I could only see the glowing parts
under its eyes, but as a child, I was like ``Is this real? Is it a video?'' and
it was over, so it would be interesting to see him swimming with night vision
goggles etc. I felt it.I think it's a popular aquarium specializing in deep-sea

Review: I don't have a octopus!The timing was quite good. Since it's Golden
Week, there was a line even before the store opened, but the line moved smoothly
from before 10am, and there were staff at key points so you could see each part
of the building.It would be a nuisance if I looked at it too closely, but I had
enough time to look at each type and it was relatively comfortable.However,
there are no dolphin show events during the day and the aquarium is small, so
you can't really spend your time fully enjoying it. I guess the rotation rate is
good for that reason.However, the souvenir corner is not good. I think it's okay
if I recommend a few more products that can only be purchased here.Personally, I
have the impression that deep sea = sleep, so if there were limited edition eye
masks, pillows, ear plugs, etc., I would have bought them...but the selection
was not as good as compared to other aquariums. did.I don't have a octopus!  The

part is that even though it says on the website that you can see the octopus,
they don't display the objects outside and inside. Just a specimen. If you don't
check before you go, you might get ripped off and end up in a lot of trouble.
Please note that if you follow the staff's instructions for exhibits near the

coelacanths. The theme is deep-sea fish, and shrimp, monkfish, sharks, giant
beetles, and more are on display. Photography is allowed, but using flash is
prohibited. Commemorative medals can be purchased near the exit. There are also
souvenirs for sale, including large coelacanth stuffed animals, pill bug-like
stuffed beetles, and other sweets. Re-entry is possible only on the same
day.Particularly impressive was the coelacanth, which is kept frozen at -20℃,
and unlike stuffed animals, I was able to see the real thing, including its
teeth and eyeballs, which was a valuable experience.Another unfortunate story is
that when engraving a name and date on a commemorative medal, if you set the
medal with the wrong side up, the image will be engraved and the paint will peel
off. The medal will be engraved from the top, so please be careful to place the

coelacanth.There are five coelacanths on display, and two of the only frozen

There are a lot of fish in a big tank and they don't swim in schools (lol).As an
``aquarium where you can see deep-sea creatures,'' it's quite enjoyable. This is
a valuable facility as there are very few places where you can see rare deep-sea
creatures alive. It is truly valuable to be able to see octopuses, giant
beetles, Japanese spider crabs, and more.I am a big fan of coelacanths, but
there are no living ones. The second floor mainly exhibits coelacanths, but
there are also models and frozen stuffed animals. There are a lot of materials
and explanatory videos about coelacanths, so those who like them may be able to
enjoy them thoroughly, but children may not like them. Even for people who say,
``I want to see fish because it's an aquarium,'' it's not great because it's
just text and photos.I felt that the entrance fee of 1,600 yen was quite
expensive. There are no advance tickets or discounts for following on SNS. It
probably costs money to maintain the facility, but considering the scale and
impact, I felt that the 800 yen admission fee was reasonable. Apparently, for a
limited time, there are discounted tickets that include a meal ticket at a
nearby restaurant. Others only offer discounts for people with disabilities and
groups.There is a souvenir shop, but I don't feel like buying a small stuffed
animal under my arm for more than 5,000 yen. It may be okay to buy small items,
but it would be much better to buy seafood or other souvenirs from nearby
shops.The only measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus are the
installation of disinfectant and no temperature checks. When it's crowded,
you'll be looking into the small display aquarium with your faces close
together, so even if you're wearing a mask, you'll be concerned.I don't think

aquarium.Still, there are real coelacanth specimens and megamouth specimens that
you can't see anywhere else.If you like deep sea life, this alone is worth the
admission fee.It's a little inconvenient in terms of access.There's no parking
lot, and it's not right in front of the station.However, if you show your
aquarium admission ticket, you can get a discount on food and drinks at nearby
restaurants, so it's a good deal.I want to come again just for the octopus.There

inevitably have to wait for a long time, and for those who are not particularly
interested in deep-sea creatures or don't have the patience, it is better to eat
expensive food at the fishing port.<Facilities/Atmosphere>Despite the small
capacity and number of people it can accommodate as a permanent facility, it's
good because it's easy to see for casual groups. However, there is a waiting
list for the aquarium, so it will take some time.There are no dining facilities,
so you can eat in the surrounding area. Well, it's crowded.And at the souvenir

to find the place. Near Numazu Port, where the fishing boats are moored, on the
east side of the road from Minato Shinsenkan, there is an area called ``Minato
Yasusanbanchi'' where there are many shops, and the aquarium is hidden
there.There is no parking lot, but I decided to stop by Minato Shinsenkan later,
so I thought it would be okay if I secretly parked there.The aquarium's
facilities are compact, and it takes less than an hour to look around.The
lighting inside the facility is dim. It seems like they are directing the world
of the deep sea, which is not bad in itself.Also, I thought the deep sea
planetarium area was some kind of illumination, but when I checked it later, I
was surprised to see glowing fish swimming at high speed.It is undeniable that
there are not many types of living fish here, and if you visit with high
expectations, you may not be satisfied, but the 1,600 yen admission fee is
reasonable as there are creatures on display that are hard to see elsewhere. I

more than public transportation amid the coronavirus crisis.There are several

waiting, so it wasn't a problem.The price is 1,600 yen for adults. Most people
were looking at it online, so I didn't see anyone complaining about how
expensive it was.The tour of the museum takes about an hour.There were various
deep-sea fish and creatures, and we had a lot of fun, but the octopus was not

the exit that allows you to re-enter. I don't know if it will fit again, but I
think it won't hurt to keep it on.There's also a bus timetable at the exit, so

Review: I went in without expecting much (^_^;), but it was a wonderful exhibit
that exceeded my expectations in a good way. Of course the coelacanth is
amazing, but I lost track of the way the other fish were displayed and the easy-
to-understand explanations. There was also a time-limited special exhibit where
you could touch deep-sea fish.

have been caught since ancient times. There are restaurants where you can eat
deep-sea fish, but the aquarium specializes in deep-sea fish, and you can see
many rare creatures that cannot be seen at other aquariums. The main attraction
is the coelacanth. You can relax and enjoy the viewing experience. Since it's a
place where you can see deep-sea fish, the illuminations are different from
other aquariums, so they look great in photos. There is no parking lot, so go to

Review: A small aquarium that focuses on deep-sea fish.On the other hand, there
are no penguins or dolphins.If you come here just to see it, you'll finish it
quickly, so some people may feel unsatisfied.Also, perhaps because it is
difficult to maintain deep-sea fish, some creatures may not be present depending
on the time of year you go (such as the Japanese octopus, which cannot be seen
in the summer), so if there are creatures you want to see, you should check the
aquarium's website in advance.There are shops and markets where you can eat
deep-sea fish, as well as observation boats nearby, so we recommend visiting
those as well, or planning a tour of Numazu city or the Izu Peninsula as
well.Visited on Public holiday  Wait time No wait  Reservation recommended Not

Review: Frozen coelacanth specimens are amazingThis aquarium mainly deals with
deep-sea fish from Suruga Bay, which boasts one of the deepest waters in Japan.
It provides detailed explanations about the ecology of deep-sea creatures, which
are often mysterious, and deepened my knowledge of deep-sea creatures that I had
only seen in illustrated books or photographs.The highlight of this aquarium is
the frozen coelacanth specimens and stuffed specimens. The frozen specimen of
the living fossil coelacanth, whose detailed ecology is a mystery, is truly a
sight to behold. I thought it was a miracle that it still exists as a living
species.NEXCO Central Japan is a fast travel ticket that allows you to travel

treated to become translucent, for a while with great interest. There was also a
frozen preserved coelacanth on display, which was also a valuable item that I
had never seen before.Deep sea creatures are interesting. I quite like it.Only
