Review: Pets allowed in the superstore, keep all pet lovers to bring those to
have a walk making noisy barking and pet smell so horribly. Most pet lovers with
dog leash keep us eyes to be aware of little kids from their pet attack and look
around any piss or waste on the super center corridor. Anyway, the Superstore
itself is so big with 4 storeys and comtemporary lifestlye design to mederate
the interior decor. Food shops are not many and quite limited mostly in the
outdoor yard zone but nice ambiencePets allowed in the superstore, keep all pet

Review: New mall open for the people who live in the suburbs specifically in
Rajapruek area. Now with the latest hype and ongoing road construction, traffic
around the mall is quite heavy so it‚Äôs better to avoid the rush hour if you want
to visit the mall. Lots of new shops and novelty restaurants for you to choose
from. Note that this mall is pet friendly meaning you can bring your pets to
stroll around the mall. There is also the running tracks for joggers and soon

Review: Central WestVille strikes a familiar chord with the cozy and inviting
atmosphere reminiscent of Central Eastville, but it stands out with its own
unique charm. This pet-friendly haven is a paradise for pet lovers, offering
well-designed indoor and outdoor spaces that cater to our furry friends. One of
the highlights is its commitment to creating a nature-infused environment,
complete with an artificial waterfall and a grand staircase at the heart of the
building, adorned with lush greenery, making it a picturesque spot for
visitors.The variety of dining options and street shops adds to the appeal,
ensuring there‚Äôs something for every palate and preference. The convenience of
having a supermarket on-site cannot be overstated, making it a one-stop
destination for shopping and leisure.However, it‚Äôs not without its drawbacks.
The traffic congestion around the area, exacerbated by ongoing road
construction, can be a significant deterrent. Additionally, the limited parking
availability further complicates accessibility. The lack of public
transportation options also poses a challenge for those relying on such
services.In essence, while Central WestVille offers a delightful experience with
its pet-friendly policies and connection to nature, visitors should be prepared
for potential traffic and parking woes.Central WestVille strikes a familiar

for 3 weeks It's just now time to bring the family here for the first time.It's
nothing. Wait for the paint to dry and the smell of the paint to fade first.
üòÜActually, I've been private since the day the mall opened. The first day there
was a lot of traffic jams and a million chickens.Good thing I'm in this area so
I can walk here.However, there were still a lot of people.The first day there
was still a lot of dust. The smell of the paint was very strong.So I'm waiting
here. Then I brought my family for a walk.Once came on Sunday There are a lot of
people, which is normal.But you can still find parking.My daughter likes it. I
like semi-outdoor malls.There are corners to play in, something a little bit
adventurous, like rock climbing, swings, jumping on ropes, things like that.I'm
asking Mamie to come play with go-karts for the kids. They're available for
driving on the 4th floor.There are many beautiful corners to take photos, but
today I was hungry and didn't take many photos. She wants to take the train.
It's the final round at 8:30 p.m. I'll make it for you.The driver gave me one
more round as well.They have 2 playgrounds, one in front of the SAEMAEUL store
on the 3rd floor. This is a big spot. There's a merry-go-round, jumping on
ropes, and rock climbing. But the wooden dice pit has already taken out the
dice. I wonder if it will disappear oftenü§£If the 2nd floor is a swing, rock
climbing, sand pit, jumping rope on a tree. It's on the front side, near the 425
shop.The train section is on the 3rd floor. Still open for free admission. No
receipt requiredThe restaurant zone is in the semi outdoor zone on the 1st and
3rd floors and inside the mall with air conditioning on the 1st floor. There are
a lot of shops, you can't sort them all.Let's come together.It is a pet friendly
department store. There may be some barking and whining mixed in with people's
voices. There was a different kind of lively atmosphere.But if anyone is afraid
of dogs, afraid of cats, afraid of barking, easily frightened, or allergic to
fur. I recommend avoiding it first.I've arrived. @CentralWestVille üéâ Shopping

quality items. It's fun to shop. Some department stores have a lot of items, but
there isn't anything worth buying. This place is beautifully decorated. It is
probably the most beautiful in this area because the malls in this area are
quite old. Personally, I like walking to this mall the most in this area. The
cinema has a laser system and the ticket prices are not too expensive too, worth
it. But I would like to complain a little about the bathrooms and traffic.
Because the bathroom has very few service channels. There are few sinks, causing
many people to wait in line to use the bathroom. Plus the traffic is very
congested almost all day. Traveling is difficult. Plus, traffic inside the mall
doesn't have many road signs or parking lots. The road is narrow, making it

eats at the same restaurant. It's a chicken rice shop. Today I met a salesperson
who made me feel not impressed at all. It's a female employee who wears glasses.
We ordered a plate of chicken rice, no vegetables at all. But the employee asked
in a curt tone and words. "Do you want the movie?" His voice was firm. He didn't
have any legs. He was confused as to whether it was this or the salesperson. I'd
like to cancel the order. I don't know if the store hired its own employees or
if the employees were affiliated with the department store. or trained to serve
customers like friends So I slammed the sound back to let people know that when
the voice is harsh, with blunt words Like being dissatisfied with the listener,
how do you feel? Finished this course I probably won't apply again. There are
many other places. Walking around the mall, there are still employees with
manners like this. The market vendors said it much better than this. Because the

Review: A lot of shops are opening up. If you don't count the first day It is
considered that there are quite a lot of parking spaces. And because of the rush
to open the mall, floor and wall work in some areas is still not complete....

just responsible for security, right? (I really doubt this.) Because we were
about to remove the car, but suddenly there was a car parked in front of us. We
looked at whether he was going to help with the cart or not. In conclusion, we
turned to look and walked away, pretending we didn't see him. Until another car
had to come down and help us to get out. So we wonder if he doesn't have this
