Review: I’ve been a consumer here for many years and really love the way they
renovated and expanded the shopping center. It now has some of my favorite food
franchises such as Fuji and they’ve always had one of my other favorites The
Salad Factory. It has a smaller gym and also a Tops Supermarket.

Review: Oh, where to begin with Robinson Lifestyle Si Saman! This beacon of
consumerism, nestled in western Bangkok, is a temple to shopping, dining, and
all things lifestyle. With its three lofty floors, it's like the shopping gods
decided to give us mere mortals a playground. Central Retail Corporation has
outdone themselves this time, aiming to capture the hearts (and wallets) of
high-spending shoppers, a noble quest indeed.Imagine, if you will, a place where
the economic, societal, and environmental growth of the community is front and
center. Yes, that's right, a shopping center claiming to care about more than
just profits—how modern! It's expected to create a thousand jobs, which is
splendid news unless you're like me, preferring the job title of 'professional
browser.'Katie, Biscuit, and I ventured through its doors, half expecting to be
lost in a commercial wonderland. And lost we did get, but not in the way you
might think. With every turn, a new discovery, from the latest fashion trends to
gadgets that I'm sure I need for reasons unknown.In the grand scheme of things,
if I were to rate Robinson Lifestyle Si Saman on a scale as unpredictable as my
dog Biscuit's dinner preferences, I'd give it a solid 287/300. Not just for its
ambitious aim to be the number one shopping center with the widest presence but
for giving us a new weekend destination where Katie can convince me I *do* need
another pair of shoes.Oh, where to begin with Robinson Lifestyle Si Saman! This

at the food court, mini supermarkets, home buys, electronics, bubble tea,
desserts. We got bubble tea and an assortment of desserts - mung bean paste

Review: The mall does not have a lot of options compared to Central malls. It
got a small tops supermarket with very limited goods on groceries and
vegetables. It has a bigger parking space but I'd rather go to a mall like
Central malls where shops are plenty. But if for daily groceries and not wanting
on brands of clothings this mall suffice plus it's a walking distance to my
place.The mall does not have a lot of options compared to Central malls. It got

problem is that it can be difficult to find a parking space at times because
there are too many taxis parked all around the carpark. In the past there was
good security in the carpark, always friendly and greeting, but now I never see

security. There are some thief and burglars living in the slums in the northern
corner of the parking lot that stole my personal belongings. It caused me a lot
of trouble and I never got my stuff back. Police was not helpful at all too.

banks, lifestyle, and a cinema on the 2nd floor. The only drawback for this
place is the parking because most of the parking space is unavailible.

looked at the customers or smiled. One staff just cut me off at the cashier
queue today to exchange her card. I told her she cut my queue and all I got was
a dirty look. Food is so so. You can find somewhere else better than this place.

Review: Staff are far too busy on thier phones. Had an absolutely terrible
experience here. Place is expensive as they have to pay staff to wander around
and chat. Went to ask for help at cashier and all I could recieve was bad looks
and rude resonses. Would suggest anyone to go to another nearby Robinsons to do
their shopping. Staff and management need serious training on customer service.
I would like to complain about the serrvice but there is none. I was ignored and
walked by , by at least a dozen staff members. All of whom were on the phones or
walking along chatting. Terrible horrible. Eventually walked out without any

fresh produce, assorted fruits. Came on a Saturday afternoon and there were a
lot of people. What I like most is that there are so many restaurants that it's
hard to choose which one to eat at.🚩 Apart from restaurants, there are also a
lot of bakeries and coffee shops. The mall area is so spacious that it's really
impossible to walk all the way through. It's a pity to be far from home.
Otherwise, I'd definitely come here often.🚩 This branch of Robinson has

Review: Report a complaint against Robinson Srisamarn Regarding parking
management for wheelchairs There were no officers standing by and watching. The
only car parked was a young man who didn't have a disability at all, but he was
able to park and walked down with a straight face. As for those of us who
actually have patients in wheelchairs, there is no place to park. We have to
park far away, and the entrance to the side is narrow. When I inquired, the
official said that if there was no space, there wouldn't be any more. Even
though there's a lot of exclusive space reserved and there's still a lot of
space, it's really bad. Do you think it's reasonable that people who really have
the right to park have their rights taken away? Try having someone inside sit in
a wheelchair and experience something like this. Their hearts are our
hearts.Report a complaint against Robinson Srisamarn Regarding parking

Review: Monday - Friday, I go to eat lunch at Robinson regularly. But today I
encountered a matter that made me angry, the matter is that Finished eating
lunch. Go buy shoes in the department store section. I found a pair I liked at
the Lourson booth, but I only had one to try on each side. Crazy!!! Whoever
wants to try on one shoe and buy it, tell the salesperson. This is likely to be
a temporary/replacement employee. I asked to try on two shoes, so the man went
and got the other shoe. which has disappeared for a very long time So we asked a
female employee wearing a Robinson uniform. Standing and talking with the
Fitflop salesperson next to me, is the shoe warehouse far away? I've been gone
for a long time. Can you please call me? It's already 1 p.m. and we're rushing
back to work. She turned around and answered curtly. He slammed his voice saying
"I'm far away" and made a face at him. And then turned their backs on us... I'm
a service worker who doesn't have any service mind at all. Even though I'm not
that old anymore, it's terrible!!! Compared to the work of employees at Central

Review: Hello….senior executive from Robinson Srisamarn Department StoreDue to
the past October 31, 2023Around 3:00-4:00 p.m., I went into the children's toy
department. to buy a radio-controlled car which is currently being organized at
a price of 299 bahtThe next day the product had a problem. Making it impossible
to run and on November 3, 2023 at around 7:00 p.m., I brought the product back
to Cliam or exchange at the same department where I encountered a male intern
student. They changed it for me as usual. Then he brought me to work with the
cashier next to the booth that sells electric irons. I met the cashier who, like
that employee, seemed to be in a hurry to finish the job for the day. When it
was my turn, the intern informed me that a customer had come to change the
product and it was discolored. The role changed immediately. Then bring the
product return form to fill out. and then overlooked me and went to another
customer and while other customers are making payments This cashier suddenly
stopped and came to talk to the student intern who was taking care of me, which
caused the flow of dealing with customers to be disrupted. #In this part, I
don't understand why they don't clear it up on a case-by-case basis, or maybe
have customers who connect after me go pay at another point instead for speed.
In order to prevent other customers from being dissatisfied with the service. If
you do that, it will look like the employees are even more professional.And this
case takes almost 15 minutes, which the cashier is a service job. But the
service person frown I don't know if I'm dissatisfied with the customers or the
interns as well and have a cough due to throat irritation, but you don't wear a
protective mask. It is considered a form of social etiquette. Because you are
working and coughing periodically after everything is cleared up. I have already
changed the product. By changing to a product with the same price I walked out
of the department as usual. Stop by to eat in the mall. I noticed that the
product had just been changed. The on/off switch of the product was damaged.
After finishing eating, I went back to the same intern student. She came to look
at it as usual, so I agreed to take another product. that is more expensive Then
you will pay more instead.After receiving the product Going to make payment,
this intern suggested that I would be better off going to another cashier point
(it's like he knew about the problem I encountered the first time with the
cashier), so he took me to the cashier point at Customer Service. The younger
brother met the senior cashier at that point and said something bad to him. Then
when I was walking to the cashier's point where I bought the product in the
first place to void in order to key in the product and add money, the employee
looked at me from head to toe like he looked down on me, which I... It's not
okay. with customer service behavior In this wayWhen I walked up to the said
cashier I was informed of the void again.But that cashier called to inform the
room that it would be void. Then use the word "Customer has bought something and
it will come to void" and then say "The customer has already bought it once."
Last time it came to void, this time it came to void again." So I said, I bought
it and I wasn't going to return it, but Both times the product had problems. It
wasn't that I wanted to Void, I came to void.All my life I have worked in
customer service. I have never acted like this towards a customer. It shouldn't
have come across anything like this.Anyway, leave it to senior management.
Please consider it.Please give 5 stars for the service to this man's intern
students.thank youHello….senior executive from Robinson Srisamarn Department

to reserve VIP rights. If it's not necessary and you have to buy a lot of stuff
but have to walk far to carry it, you'll probably have to go somewhere else.

Review: The mall near the house has a full restaurant.Today I went to buy some
stuff at Top Supermarket. There were a lot of customers at every counter, very
long lines. There were nearly ten people waiting in each line. There are
approximately 3-4 counters open for service. But there is one channel where few
people can accept payment for 8 items. The employee informed us that he could
receive no more than 8 pieces. So I informed the staff that right now there are
a lot of people in every channel around 7 p.m. Please help me calculate the
money because it is a chaotic time. But the employee instead called the manager
and made a dissatisfied tone and expression on the other end of the line. Please
help me. The customer wants to pay for the products separately and the customer
seems dissatisfied. I mean, wait a minute. Do you work in customer service and
say that every channel is crowded? You should look up and consider whether it's
true or not. Please use your heart to work. It's not like they said you can only
charge 8 pieces of money. You just have to bury your head and do just that. You
should solve the problem directly. Even if your boss tells you that the lines
are long, every line is for customers to go, you still don't want to do it. I
don't think you should come to do service work. You take advantage of your co-
workers. Because there are very few people in your area but you don't want to
charge money for customers. This cashier in the bakery department can tell you
that it's bad. and then speak so that other customers will look at us as taking
advantage of other customers I would like to suggest that people like this
should be trained more and not allowed to display bad behavior again. Because
next time, I probably won't be the only one who won't go shopping. There will
definitely be many others.The mall near the house has a full restaurant.  Today
