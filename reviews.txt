Review: The tenderloin with pesto rice was excellent. The beef was indeed
tender, very well cooked at medium rare, and the simple salad was fresh. Very
tasty indeed, and very reasonably priced. Definitely worth a visit if you're a
beef lover.Food: 4/5  |  Service: 4/5  |  Atmosphere: 4/5Recommended dishes

Review: Every dish tastes good. Good quality meat, very flavorful. The owner
imports the meat from New Zealand. You can trust the quality.Sous vide Beef
tongue is also my favorite dish, highly recommended. For people who don't eat
beef The pork here is marinated, flavorful and tender. Must try!Reasonable
price. I will definitely come back again.Food: 5/5  |  Service:

will focus on beef and pork. Every menu item is sous vide until soft. Seasoned
just right, smells good, and has a lot of meat. And a lot of side dishes. The
shop is clean. There is an open kitchen in the shop. You can see the chef
cooking and feel the atmosphere. The smell is not bad. There is a bathroom
